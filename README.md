# AI-Driven Real-Time Fashion Trend Detection and Design Generation
Overview

This project builds an AI-powered system that detects Gen Z fashion trends in real-time, understands the story behind trends, segments users based on preferences, and generates design prototypes using generative AI models. It combines computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, and generative AI into a seamless workflow.

Features
Real-time scraping of fashion content from blogs, websites, and social media.

Trend detection using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) for multimodal analysis.

Context understanding using BERT for extracting deeper narrative insights.

Personalized targeting by segmenting Gen Z audience preferences with machine learning.

Design prototype generation using Stable Diffusion for rapid design ideation.

End-to-end automation from data collection to design generation.

Tech Stack
Data Collection: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, API integrations

AI Models: CLIP (OpenAI), BERT (Google), Stable Diffusion

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Matplotlin

Visualization: Streamlit



How It Works
Data scraping gathers fashion content.

CLIP analyzes both text and images to detect trends.

BERT extracts deeper context and inspiration behind trends.

Machine learning algorithms segment Gen Z audiences based on fashion preferences.

Stable Diffusion generates visual design prototypes based on the identified trends.

Dashboards display trends, segmented audiences, and AI-generated designs.
